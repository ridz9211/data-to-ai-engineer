# data-to-ai-engineer
My structured transition from Data Engineer (10 yrs) to AI Engineer, focusing on production-ready AI systems, ML fundamentals, and agentic AI.

# Data Engineer → AI Engineer

This repository documents my structured transition from a senior
data engineer (10+ years experience in SQL, Snowflake, cloud)
to an AI Engineer focused on production-grade AI systems.

## Background
- 10 years experience in data engineering
- Strong SQL, Snowflake, Python
- Cloud experience (AWS / Azure)
- Focused on scalable, reliable data pipelines

## Why AI
Modern AI systems fail not because of models,
but because of poor data quality, pipelines, and monitoring.
My goal is to bridge this gap.

## Learning Areas
- Python for ML
- Machine Learning fundamentals
- Deep Learning
- Generative AI
- Agentic AI systems
- MLOps & production deployment

## Philosophy
- Production > notebooks
- Systems thinking over hype
- Strong data foundations before models
